- Support for both px and rem units with accessibility considerations

**Professional Interface**
- Drag-and-drop size management for easy reordering
- Real-time preview showing actual scaling behavior at min/max viewports

- CSS Custom Properties (--fs-lg, --fs-md, --fs-sm)  
- HTML Tag Styles (h1, h2, p, etc.)
- Tailwind Configuration Objects (fontSize export)

**WordPress Integration**
- Works with any theme (block themes, classic themes, custom themes)
- Compatible with page builders (Elementor, Gutenberg, Beaver Builder)
- No external dependencies - fully self-contained
- Performance optimized with local processing

### Perfect For

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is fluid typography?

Fluid typography uses CSS clamp() functions to create font sizes that scale smoothly between minimum and maximum values based on viewport width. Instead of using breakpoints that jump between fixed sizes, fluid typography provides seamless scaling across all screen sizes.

### Do I need coding knowledge to use this plugin?

The plugin generates the CSS code for you, but you'll need basic knowledge of how to add CSS to your WordPress site (through theme customizer, child theme, or custom CSS plugins). The generated code is ready to copy and paste.

### Will this slow down my website?

No. Fluid Font Forge runs only in the WordPress admin area and generates CSS for you to implement. It has zero impact on your website's frontend performance.

### Does this work with page builders?

Yes. The generated CSS works with any WordPress theme or page builder. You can use the CSS classes in Elementor, apply the custom properties in Gutenberg, or implement the tag styles globally.

### What's the difference between px and rem units?

Pixels (px) provide predictable sizing but don't respect user browser settings. Rem units scale with the user's browser font size preferences, making your site more accessible. We recommend using rem for better accessibility.

### Can I export my font sizes?

The plugin provides copy-to-clipboard functionality for all generated CSS. For Tailwind users, it generates complete fontSize configuration objects you can paste directly into your tailwind.config.js file.

### How do I implement the generated CSS?

Copy the generated CSS and add it to your theme through:
- **Theme Customizer**: Appearance > Customize > Additional CSS
- **Child Theme**: Add to your style.css file
- **CSS Plugins**: Use plugins like "Easy Custom CSS" or "SiteOrigin CSS"

### Does this work with WordPress 6.1+ fluid typography?

Yes. While WordPress 6.1+ includes basic fluid typography support via theme.json, Fluid Font Forge provides advanced mathematical control, multiple output formats, and a user-friendly interface that complements the core functionality.

### Can I preview fonts with custom web fonts?

Yes. The plugin includes a preview font feature where you can paste a WOFF2 font URL to see how your sizes look with custom fonts.

### What if I need help or have feature requests?

Use the WordPress.org support forum for this plugin. We actively monitor and respond to support requests and feature suggestions.
