# Font Clamp Calculator (FCC)

A WordPress tool for generating responsive CSS `clamp()` statements across device breakpoints from mobile to desktop and beyond.

## Project Overview

Font Clamp Calculator is a comprehensive WordPress snippet system that provides developers with an intuitive interface for creating fluid typography that scales perfectly across all device sizes. Currently implemented as five coordinated segments, the project is being refactored into a single, distributable snippet.

## Current Status

**Phase:** Multi-segment to single-snippet refactoring  
**Target:** Production-ready tool for WordPress developer community  
**Tech Stack:** WordPress + Elementor Pro + Admin Site Enhancements Pro

## Features

- **Interactive Preview Panel** - Live font size demonstrations
- **Multi-Device Targeting** - Mobile to desktop+ breakpoints  
- **Class Management** - Organized font size class system
- **Export Functionality** - Ready-to-use CSS output
- **Import/Export Settings** - Project portability

## Current Segments

1. **Primary** - Unified styles and common elements
2. **Segment A** - Foundation code and data management
3. **Segment B** - Core interface components  
4. **Segment C** - Advanced features and preview functionality
5. **Segment D** - Import/export and CSS output generation

## Development Workflow

This project uses a systematic approach to prevent capability loss during refactoring:

- **Chat Kickoff Templates** - Standardized session initialization
- **Git Version Control** - All changes tracked and archived
- **Component Documentation** - Detailed functional specifications
- **Progress Tracking** - Clear milestone and task management

## Technical Challenges

- Event timing dependencies between segments
- Duplicate data management consolidation  
- Multiple asset loading coordination
- Default data method conflicts resolution
